## The tech
Web application built using Typescript, React and Redux, deployed with AWS Amplify. 

# Description:
The app spins up a web page where multiple text or code editors can be initialized as needed. The text editors format Markdown for the purpose of note-taking (Documentation) whereas the code editors take any JS or JSX code and run it.


## AWS Amplify
- [Initializing](https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/tools/cli/start/set-up-cli/#configure-the-amplify-cli) a new project;
- When youâ€™re ready to add a feature, run `amplify add <category>`.

> Note: Use `--legacy-peer-deps` to  restore peerDependency installation behavior from NPM v4 through v6. Issue seems to stem from using react v 17+. See following stackoverflow [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66239691/what-does-npm-install-legacy-peer-deps-do-exactly-when-is-it-recommended-wh) for more info on the matter.
